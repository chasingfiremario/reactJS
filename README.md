This code demonstrates a React component that uses GraphQL to retrieve data about education. It makes use of the graphql-request library to render the fetched data in the component and to create GraphQL queries.

Please take note that you should change the GraphQL query (query) to fit your particular data structure and replace "https://your-graphql-endpoint-url.com" with the URL of the real GraphQL API endpoint.

Make sure you have the required packages as well. graphql-request
